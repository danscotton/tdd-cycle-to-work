Feature: Should I cycle to work?

    As a cycle commuter
    I want to know the weather conditions along my route to work
    So that I know whether it is a good day to cycle

        # home: 51.222, -56.2222
        # work: 50.12, -45.222
    Scenario: Add a route
        Given I have no configured routes
        When I supply the following route data of my commute
            | place | x    | y    |
            | start | 51.2 | 34.3 |
            | end   | 51.9 | 35.7 |
        Then my route is saved

    # Scenario: Add commuting times
    #     Given I have pre-configured a route
    #     When I supply times and days of my commute
    #     Then my route has assacoated commute times

        # what's the weather along my route like today?
